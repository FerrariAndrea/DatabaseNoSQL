# Neo4J

[Neo4J official guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/)

Neo4J is a native graph database. A Neo4J database is a collection of nodes, and every node can be linked to the other through relations. This allows you to query the database with a complex relation request among the data, faster than other databses (Neo4J relations vs index).

# The Property Graph Model
In Neo4j, information is organized as nodes, relationships, and properties. Nodes are the entities in the graph.

- Nodes can be tagged with labels, representing their different roles in your domain. (For example, Person).
- Nodes can hold any number of key-value pairs, or properties. (For example, name)
- Node labels may also attach metadata (such as index or constraint information) to certain nodes.

Relationships provide directed, named, connections between two node entities (e.g. Person LOVES Person).

- Relationships always have a direction, a type, a start node, and an end node, and they can have properties, just like nodes.
- Nodes can have any number or type of relationships without sacrificing performance.
- Although relationships are always directed, they can be navigated efficiently in any direction.
